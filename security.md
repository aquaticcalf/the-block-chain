CertifyChain Security
=====================

**Overview**
------------

The CertifyChain platform prioritizes security and integrity, utilizing a robust authentication system and cryptographic primitives to protect the certificate data.

**Authentication**
----------------

The platform uses elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) to ensure secure communication between nodes. ECC provides a high level of security while minimizing computational overhead.

**Data Encryption**
-----------------

The platform uses AES-256 encryption to protect certificate data at rest and in transit.

**Access Control**
-----------------

The platform implements role-based access control (RBAC) to ensure that only authorized entities can issue, revoke, or verify certificates.

**Security Audits**
-----------------

The platform undergoes regular security audits to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.

**Best Practices**
-----------------

- Follow secure coding practices to prevent common vulnerabilities.
- Use secure communication protocols to protect data in transit.
- Implement secure storage solutions to protect data at rest.
