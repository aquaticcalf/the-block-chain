CertifyChain Architecture
==========================

**Overview**
------------

The CertifyChain platform is built using a decentralized architecture, consisting of a blockchain core, a peer-to-peer (P2P) network, and a certificate management system.

**Blockchain Core**
-----------------

The blockchain core is responsible for managing the certificate data and ensuring its integrity. It consists of the following components:

* **Block**: A data structure that contains a list of transactions and a unique identifier.
* **Transaction**: A data structure that represents a certificate issuance, revocation, or verification.
* **Chain**: A data structure that stores the entire history of transactions.

**P2P Network**
-------------

The P2P network is responsible for node communication and transaction validation. It consists of the following components:

* **Node**: A peer that participates in the network, responsible for validating transactions and maintaining a copy of the blockchain.
* **Network**: A decentralized network of nodes that communicate with each other to validate transactions and maintain the integrity of the blockchain.

**Certificate Management**
-------------------------

The certificate management system is responsible for managing the lifecycle of certificates, including issuance, revocation, and verification. It consists of the following components:

* **Certificate**: A digital document that represents a skill, qualification, or achievement.
* **Certificate Authority**: A trusted entity that issues and revokes certificates.
* **Certificate Repository**: A data structure that stores issued certificates.

**Security**
------------

The CertifyChain platform utilizes a robust authentication system, including elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) and other cryptographic primitives, to ensure secure communication between nodes and protect the integrity of the certificate data.
